Little Farm Story Cheats 100K coins remove ads HACKS tips - Another benefit of Little Farm Story's free market is that you can actually double the price of goods. Each project starts at a base price determined arbitrarily by the game, and if you click the plus sign on the price tag, you can maximize it to twice the amount. The price applies to each item, so if you sell 1 piece of butter at a base price of 23 gold, you can sell it for 46 gold when the price reaches its peak. If you sell 2 pieces of butter at the highest price, you can get up to 92 gold. Each slot can sell up to 10 identical items.
